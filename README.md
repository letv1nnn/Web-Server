# ***Web Server***
(Not completed yet)

## *Drscription*
This project is a multithreaded web server that I built from scratch. I deployed it on an old laptop, effectively turning it into my own self-hosted server. Now I have a working, home-built web server running locally.

## *Technologies*
I used Docker to containerize the server by creating a custom image and deploying it there. Additionally, I used Rustâ€™s build system, Cargo, along with shell scripts to simplify the build and execution process.

## *Build and Run*
- *Building*
```bash
sh build/prep.sh
```
- *Running*
```bash
sh build/run.sh
```
- *Cleaning*
```bash
sh build/clean.sh
```

## *Usage Scenarios*
This server can be used in several practical contexts:

- **Personal Website Hosting**: Host static HTML/CSS/JS websites directly from your home network.
- **File Server**: Share files locally or over your LAN using simple HTTP endpoints.
- **REST API**: Serve basic JSON-based APIs for apps or IoT devices.
- **Local Dev Server**: Use as a lightweight backend for testing frontend applications.
- **Learning Platform**: A great base to experiment with HTTP internals, async Rust, and server design.
- **Edge Device Service Host**: Deploy it on a low-power device (e.g., old laptop, Raspberry Pi) to run small services at the network edge.
